        Welcome to Prince Andrew Sim (name pending)! <br>
        In this game, you are Prince Andrew himself, left alone to your devices in Buckingham Palace or whatever. <br>
        You have made the horrifying revelation that Dracula resides within and has a taste for your blood. Alas, you would surely seem insane if you told the public. <br>
        However, you have the power of the royal guard, the nation's best spies, as many Catholics as you can imagine, and taxes on your side. <br><br>
        Investigate to grow closer to finding dracula, hire guards to fend him off, hire priests to temporarily thwart him, and impose taxes to improve your income. Good luck. 
    </p>
